## More about me

I'm a software engineer based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with a passion for game development. I've been fascinated by computers and programming since a young age, and I've developed a diverse skill set over the years.

I've had experience working as a Quality Engineer and Software Developer, where I've honed my skills in C#, .NET, and Unity3D. My goal is to transition into the game industry, where I can combine my technical expertise with my passion for gaming to create immersive experiences for players around the world.

I believe in constantly learning and pushing boundaries, both in my professional and personal endeavors.
